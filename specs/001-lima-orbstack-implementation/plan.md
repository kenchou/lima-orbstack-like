# Implementation Plan: Lima OrbStack 类似功能实现

**Branch**: `001-lima-orbstack-implementation` | **Date**: 2025-10-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-lima-orbstack-implementation/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature implements a Lima-based virtual machine environment that provides an OrbStack-like experience for macOS users. The primary requirement is to create a one-click installation process that sets up a Linux environment with service access via servicename.local domain names. The technical approach involves using Lima for VM management, Kubernetes for container orchestration, MetalLB for load balancing services, and a setup script with proper macOS permission handling for automation. The solution prioritizes ease of use over security, handles macOS system integrity protection appropriately by requesting minimum necessary permissions, targets single-user development environments, and includes comprehensive troubleshooting documentation in Chinese.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Shell scripting (bash) for setup scripts, YAML for configuration files  
**Primary Dependencies**: Lima, Kubernetes, MetalLB, CoreDNS, Docker CLI, Shell logging utilities  
**Storage**: N/A (virtual machine environment with persistent storage)  
**Testing**: Manual verification of setup process and service accessibility  
**Target Platform**: macOS 12.x (Monterey) or higher with Lima support
**Project Type**: Infrastructure-as-Code with configuration files and setup scripts
**Performance Goals**: Environment setup with correctness prioritized over speed, service access 95% of the time as specified in requirements, 95% installation success rate with proper permission handling. Performance targets as specified in requirements (setup within 5 minutes) are secondary to correct installation and configuration per clarification on FR-012.  
**Constraints**: Single-user development environment, minimal security requirements prioritizing ease of use and proper macOS permission handling  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user development environment, no multi-user support required

**Structure Decision**: This is an Infrastructure-as-Code project using Lima and Kubernetes configuration files with a primary setup script. The structure reflects the project's nature as a virtualization environment setup tool rather than a traditional software application. The main components are the Lima configuration file (orbstack-like.yaml), the setup script with macOS permission handling (setup.sh), and supporting documentation in Chinese.
